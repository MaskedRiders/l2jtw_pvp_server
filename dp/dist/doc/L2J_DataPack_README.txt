L2J-DataPack is *NOT* L2J-Server. L2J-Server is *NOT* L2J-DataPack. Comments, questions, 
suggestions etc. should be directed to the appropriate forums.

Any given DataPack copy you get, is designed/optimized to work with an specific 
L2J build. Ensure your core and DataPack revisions match each other.

This readme assumes a basic understanding of MySQL commands and internals, SQL 
queries, or at least familiarity with a MySQL frontend. This readme will not 
teach you how to install MySQL nor will it teach you to use MySQL or any MySQL 
frontend. This readme is for the sole purpose of providing a brief overview of 
how to either install or upgrade the data in your database.


Installation:

All users: Copy all the datapack content to your gameserver directory/folder.
(for example C:\L2J\gameserver for Win users, /opt/l2j/gameserver for *nix)
You'd know if you are doing it right if you're being asked about overwriting
the data folder and/or its content, since L2J core includes a basic skeleton of
it. It's safe to answer 'yes' at this point.

For new L2J databases or existing databases where you want to delete character 
and account information: Create your loginserver and gameserver databases so they 
match the loginserver.properties and server.properties settings respectively (the 
default for both is 'l2jdb'.)

Method 1: run database_installer.bat for windows users, or database_installer.sh for
linux/unix users.
Method 2: Select your database and run all the batch scripts in the sql folder

For existing L2J databases where you want to keep character and account 
information: 

Method 1: Run database_installer.bat for windows users, or 
database_installer.sh for linux/unix users. Choose (u)pgrade when asked.
Method 2: Select your database and run all the batch scripts in the 
sql folder that correspond to tables in your database that are missing or you 
want to upgrade.


IMPORTANT: 	There may also be changes altering table structures, if you need  such
an update after some certain changeset, you should run the relevant SQL sequence from
/sql/updates/. Database_installer tool will provide a way for you to execute them all.
